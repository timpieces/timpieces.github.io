I joined some friends for 3 days in Japan and tried skiing with no instruction at all, and my friends were snowboarders. It went as poorly as you&rsquo;d expect.</p><p>The main reason I&rsquo;m unlikely to try again is how dangerous skiing feels. I haven&rsquo;t looked up the statistics (and probably I should), but the handwavy &ldquo;Nah I&rsquo;ve still ok&rdquo; response I get when I mention it to skiiers and snowboarders doesn&rsquo;t fill me with confidence.</p><p>Very happy to have tried. Will be very happy to never do again.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
