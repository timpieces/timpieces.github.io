We were brainstorming ideas to replace our friends who were leaving Singapore. We resolved to organise a photowalk to meet people and for my friend to improve his photography skills. The hook of our walk would be that it is followed by a social hour where the attendees share a beer.</p><p>We set up the group and started walking. We went from three attendees (just us) to around twenty attendees in a few weeks.</p><p>I was able to learn many new marketing skills from this:</p><ul><li>I built an SEO-friendly website with claude/codex at <a href=https://shotsnshots.org>https://shotsnshots.org</a></li><li>I learned how to use instagram for running a group. Creating posts and stories, using the inbuilt editor, etc.</li><li>We&rsquo;ve used a number of event sites for marketing, and it&rsquo;s been useful to know which sites are good for certain things.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ve never had to do something like this before, so it&rsquo;s been very valuable knowledge. It feels likely I&rsquo;ll be able to apply it in future.</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s been such a public project, it&rsquo;s been fun to discuss with friends and work on it together.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
