Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t bother considering this as an endeavour worth mentioning, except that it&rsquo;s a sport that I&rsquo;ve since had occasion to play casually quite a few times.
I played with a friend during university, and colleagues at multiple workplaces.
I&rsquo;ve never had any formal training, but I&rsquo;ve got enough of the basics to play a decent game.</p><p>The sport itself is well designed and good fun. I always preferred it to tennis. It felt more intense and there was much more playtime during a session.
It was good reinforcement of hand-eye coordination that I&rsquo;ve used in multiple other sports since (badminton, table tennis, tennis).</p><p>I can see myself playing more squash in the future.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
