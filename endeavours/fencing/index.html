On the way to the gym I noticed a fencing club, so I decided to give it a shot. I messaged the number and after a few months they said they were organising an adult beginners course. I signed up.</p><p>The class was foil. I diligently did my drills and learned my footwork. I did my parries and ripostes. We lunged&mldr; a lot.</p><p>After a few lessons we did some sparring and it became a lot more fun.</p><p>In the end I stopped because my fencing gym moved out of my building and to another part of Singapore. It would have gone from a 2 minute commute to a 30 minute commute, and I couldn&rsquo;t justify that. One part of fencing that annoyed me is that it is too hard to get practice outside of class. I didn&rsquo;t have a practice partner. The club itself mostly focuses on kids and the adults class doesn&rsquo;t have much focus.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
