Kids eh? Not much to say here but I remember being terrible in games, but really enjoying practice.</p><p>University gave me plenty of spare time, so I took to improving at shooting hoops. The games were much more casual, half-court, and often we&rsquo;d just do shooting games. I got a lot of enjoyment out of this, and later in life when living near a basketball court I usually buy a basketball so that I can shoot hoops. I think my form is decent and I hope to live near a hoop again sometime soon.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
