The idea was that you sleep as little as you can and you build a game over 48 hours.</p><p>After some initial brainstorming, we settled on a game where you played as a lamb trying to escape a sacrifice. There was a procedurally generated world that you ran through, and you had to escape the tribespeople trying to catch you.</p><p>At the time, we were a little bit disappointed with our game. All of the other participants had used unity and had created much more impressive games. Our more manual approach seemed to have taken more effort but provided a worse result.</p><p>Looking back I see it differently. The game is quite good for 48 hours work, regardless of the technology used. The fact that we didn&rsquo;t use the best tools available just makes it feel more impressive and unique.</p><p><em>NB: I&rsquo;ve pulled some of this content from my github.
