It seemed very vain and an expensive way to get exercise.
During covid I tried some at-home calisthenics. It seemed more stimulating than training at a gym. While learning about the basics of calisthenics I became more aware of the benefits of a gym. This learning coupled with encouragement and guidance from a friend led me to try a single session, followed by a two-week trial, followed by a (now 4+ year) membership.</p><p>The heath benefits of resistance training are well documented and becoming more widely known. For the me major other benefit that it brought me was strong routine and more physical self-confidence. I didn&rsquo;t have particularly poor self-confidence before, but being in good physical shape certainly helps and I&rsquo;ve not had any body confidence issues at all since starting (even when my weight fluctuates).
Attending the gym changed me from a night owl into an early bird. Towards the end of covid there was even more reason to avoid busy gyms, and attending at 5am became my strategy for this. The sense of routine that I got from waking up consistently early to go to the gym was something that I sorely needed at the time, and is something that has stuck.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t persistently improved at the gym, but I don&rsquo;t have a strong interest in this while it still serves my purpose of adding discipline to my life. My physique is good but not exceptional, and I&rsquo;m happy with this.</p><p>The date on this entry is 2021 as it&rsquo;s when I first start going to the gym, but I&rsquo;m still a regular gym-goer as of mid-2025 and I hope this continues.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
