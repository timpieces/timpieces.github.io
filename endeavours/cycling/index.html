I&rsquo;ve never even watched a Tour de France stage. I like cycling because:</p><ul><li>Riding fast downhill is thrilling (while feeling relatively safe)</li><li>It&rsquo;s good, low-impact exercise</li><li>It came to me at a time in life when I had forgotten how important hobbies are</li></ul><p>The first two points are self-explanatory.</p><p>In 2018 I had been focusing on my career to the exclusion of everything else. I slept on a mattress on the floor, owned very little, and had no hobbies. I would spend the weekend relaxing, drinking, socialising, playing the odd video game. It wasn&rsquo;t a fulfilling life.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t recall the spark, but I tested the cycling waters and found that I really enjoyed it. It cumulatively brought me a lot of happiness of the years since.
It became an important lesson for me. A good hobby can more than pay for all the hobbies you try that you don&rsquo;t enjoy.</p><h1 id=my-cycling-journey>My Cycling Journey</h1><h2 id=2000---kids>2000 - Kids</h2><p>We always had bikes as kids, but once we hit secondary school, we lived in a place without much cycling infrastructure, so I stopped riding completely.</p><h2 id=2018---testing-the-waters>2018 - Testing the Waters</h2><p>I was inspired to take up adult cycling by&mldr; a bike path. I was living in Sydney and a long bike path on the North Shore ran past my apartment. Very aware that I may not like cycling, I bought the cheapest new bike that I could justify:</p><p><img src=./pedalranger.jpg alt="First Bike"></p><p>It was a 300AUD &lsquo;Pedal Ranger&rsquo; mountain bike from 99Bikes. It wasn&rsquo;t great at dealing with Sydney&rsquo;s hills, but it was enough to get me started. Some months later, I was enjoying it, so I thought it was time to level up the bike:</p><p><img src=./meridaspeeder.jpg alt="Second Bike"></p><p>I bought a Merida Speeder 100 hybrid bike for around 700AUD. I don&rsquo;t remember much about the bike but I remember it fondly and would recommend it. Another great thing about having a cheap bike is that I learned a lot about bike maintenance; I wasn&rsquo;t scared of breaking something at this price.
Almost a year later, I was enjoying cycling enough that I wanted to get a road bike.</p><h2 id=2019---the-canyon>2019 - The Canyon</h2><p><img src=./canyon.jpg alt="Road Bike"></p><p>I bought a Canyon Ultimate CF SL 7.0 for 3000AUD. Besides the car that I bought as a teenager and my university degree, this was the most expensive purchase I had ever made.</p><p>It was a great bike and I remember this time very fondly.</p><ul><li>I did lots of riding around Sydney&rsquo;s beautiful Northern Beaches.</li><li>I bought a kickr smart trainer and rode on Zwift during covid.</li><li>I completed the Sydney to Wollongong ride (a very hilly ~80km ride) twice.</li><li>On holidays I would rent bikes in tourist regions to explore.</li><li>I started a (small, casual) commuting club at work and frequently rode to/from work.</li></ul><p>I rode the Canyon regularly while I lived in Sydney until mid-2022, and then sold the bike in 2023 after it sat idle for a year. I was moving to Singapore and wasn&rsquo;t optimistic about the cycling scene there.</p><h2 id=2025---singapore-group-rides>2025 - Singapore Group Rides</h2><p><img src=./vanrysel.jpg alt="Decathlon Bike"></p><p>I was wrong about the cycling scene in Singapore. The country is as flat as a pancake, and there are many dedicated road cyclists.
After working for two years in Singapore and exhausting every run club I could find, I decided to get back on the bike.
Having previously owned an &rsquo;expensive&rsquo; road bike, I felt I had license to go cheaper this time. At least I&rsquo;d be aware of what I was missing out on.</p><p>I bought a Van Rysel RCR 900 AF 105 for 1600SGD (approx 1900AUD). I was very skeptical of buying a bike from Decathlon, but the reviews were good and a 105 groupset is typically considered the cheapest &lsquo;serious&rsquo; groupset.</p><p>My view with buying this bike was to join group rides. Singapore roads are quite daunting for the solo rider. I&rsquo;ve joined a few rides, and this story still continues as I write this&mldr; to be updated.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
