3D printing felt like a good bridge to the physical world. I bought a 3d printer in mid-2025. The main purpose was to learn a little about 3d modelling and a little about 3d printing; enough to get the &lsquo;80% of projects&rsquo; that I&rsquo;d want to be able to do.</p><p>So far I&rsquo;ve been finding the hobby a lot of fun. I&rsquo;ve set a rough goal to do one print per day. I&rsquo;ve got a bambu labs a1 which has been very stable.</p><p>My biggest surprise has been just how easy it is. It really does feel like a glimpse of the future where &lsquo;postage&rsquo; is a thing of the past and you can just print anything that you need at home from some raw materials.</p><p>For CAD, I&rsquo;ve been learning freecad. I&rsquo;ve found it extremely clunky, but the alternatives are uninspiring in other ways (restrictive licensing, annoying cloud dependencies, etc). I expect that similar to programming, the exact tool doesn&rsquo;t matter much until you get to expert level.</p><p>My score rationale:</p><ul><li>Effort: As of writing, I&rsquo;ve only had the printer a few weeks.</li><li>Learning: It&rsquo;s very different to what I&rsquo;ve done in the past. And forcing myself to print each day is very useful. Happy with my rate of learning.</li><li>Enjoyment: 3d modelling is calming; like painting. Seeing a model become reality is very satisfying.</li><li>Success: It&rsquo;s still relatively novel, and people are impressed by custom 3d prints. I&rsquo;ve been surprised by how good and professional simple prints look. It&rsquo;s a great reward for such little effort so far.</li></ul><h1 id=notable-prints>Notable Prints</h1><h2 id=camera-logo-phone-case>Camera Logo Phone Case</h2><p>I organise a photo walk with my friend. When starting out, I bought a cheap phone case that looked like a camera. It was a fun prop. But it became useless after two months when I bought a new phone. I figured I&rsquo;d try to print a new one of a custom design.</p><p>For our marketing, we had ChatGPT generate a logo that we&rsquo;ve been using. The goal was to design a phone case in the shape of our logo.</p><p><img src=./phonecase.jpg alt="Logo Phone Case"></p><h2 id=toothbrush-holder>Toothbrush Holder</h2><p>I came up with the idea of using our building as a toothbrush holder a year or two ago. It&rsquo;s well suited as our building has two large holes running down the center of the residential floors at the top.
This project was mostly to satisfy the itch of achieving something that I had mentioned over a year ago. It&rsquo;s a nice feeling when the projects you mentioned go from &ldquo;oh you will never do that&rdquo; to &ldquo;oh you did it, it just took longer than expected&rdquo;.</p><p><img src=./toothbrush.jpg alt="Toothbrush Holder"></p><h2 id=toy-chess-set>Toy Chess Set</h2><p>This was a quick design. For my robot arm I was wanting to do some computer vision to detect chessboards. I didn&rsquo;t own a chessboard, and so I thought that printing a small one would be useful.
I spent quite a while trying to design a way for it to fast together without screws, as I want to be able to print the board modularly. This meant that I&rsquo;d be able to make the board bigger when I wanted to and everything could fit on the print bed. I wasn&rsquo;t very happy with the fastening mechanism that I used, but it worked ok.</p><p><img src=./chess.jpg alt="Toy Chess Set"></p><h2 id=robot>Robot</h2><p>The robot itself is detailed more in my <a href=/endeavours/robot-arm/>Robot Arm</a> endeavour.</p><p>I went through many many iterations on this design. The main steps are shown in the photo below, but needless to say there was quite a bit more than this (e.g. it doesn&rsquo;t show the last design, nor the clamp).</p><p><img src=./robot.jpg alt=Robot></p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
