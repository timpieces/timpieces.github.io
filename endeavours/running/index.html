Noone ever explained to me that running is supposed to be uncomfortable, and so I was terrible at it. Being terrible at something as a kid is a surefire way to hate it the rest of your life.</p><p>In late high-school I was overweight, and I took up some running to lose weight. It worked and I got down to a healthy weight (although still not &lsquo;slim&rsquo;). But I never got interested in running itself, and I doubt I surpassed 5km.</p><p>In university I took up running again to lose weight. I got down to an unhealthy weight - and was very slim. Partly this is because my university diet was mostly two-meat-pies-per-day. I had a very poor understanding of nutrition at the time.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I moved to Singapore in 2023 that I started to enjoy running. The trick? Running socially. Truth be told I still never enjoyed the act of running itself, but meeting new people and chatting more than offset the discomfort. This led to some improvement in my fitness, which snowballed into a respect (but still not an enjoyment) of running itself.</p><p>This culminated in a half-marathon in 2024, and a full marathon in 2025. While I don&rsquo;t love running enough to do it again, running a marathon was a fun goal and a good personal achievement to tick-off.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
