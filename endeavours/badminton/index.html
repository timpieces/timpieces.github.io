Sports felt like a good way to do this, and choosing a popular local sport felt like a good way to make friends while integrating into the culture.</p><p>I found a meetup group which organised games and you could pay to join. It was suitable for beginners. I did a single coached lesson to understand the basics and then I started playing.</p><p>Over around 6 months I tried to play once per week. The games took me to many parts of Singapore that I otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have a good reason to go to. I met many nice people, but didn&rsquo;t make any friends through the process.</p><p>My main dislike of (beginner) mixed doubles badminton is that the strategy favours hitting to the weaker player. In beginner groups, this usually translates to the woman on the team. This means that played beginner mixed doubles as a man is less active and less fun. I would guess that this evens out when you hit intermediate level, but I suspect that would take years of play or much more time to practice (that I didn&rsquo;t have because of work).</p><p>In the end I decided to hang up my racket. I&rsquo;m glad that I know the rules and I may play casual games in the future, but I don&rsquo;t see myself going back to badminton soon.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
