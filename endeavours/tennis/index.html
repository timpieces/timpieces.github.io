I don&rsquo;t remember how long we took the weekend classes for, but it was at most a year or two.
There are some minor regrets here. While I don&rsquo;t think tennis is a very well-designed sport (at least when it comes to playing for fun), I think it&rsquo;s a great outlet for kids to learn about competition. Australia has a lot of infrastructure around it and a big tennis following and community. As someone who struggled to understand the mechanics of team sports, there&rsquo;s a good chance that I&rsquo;d have responded well to a competitive individual sport. And it likely would have helped the fact that I was an overweight kid too.
That being said, I don&rsquo;t think our parents had a lot of money to put us through something like tennis lessons unless we showed some significant passion. I think this is a reasonable decision.</p><p>I picked tennis up again in Sydney when a friend and his colleagues needed a fourth player. Their previous fourth player was moving away. We played many times over the course of a few years. None of us were any good and the games were mostly determined by unforced errors. Still, it was a great social outlet when I didn&rsquo;t have many friends at the time.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
