This turned out to be great, as the association organises many activities and is full of great people. Through this association, I picked up casual mahjong games.</p><p>The association plays the &lsquo;British&rsquo; version of Mahjong, which is not well known and I think quite different to any of the America/Chinese/Singaporean rules. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure how representative it is of Mahjong in general, and I&rsquo;m not confident that I have a good feel for &lsquo;Mahjong&rsquo; having only played this variant.</p><p>Still, I was glad to at least get some basic familiarity. The teacher, Sue, is a great teacher and very kind and community focused. Everyone else at the mahjong nights was also lovely.</p><p>Overall I had a good experience, and will likely go back while I&rsquo;m still in Singapore. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t love Mahjong, but I can&rsquo;t tell how much of it is due to the exact variant that we play. The base rules seem quite sensible and similar to any card game, but the complexity introduced by the special hands isn&rsquo;t compensated for by additional gameplay depth.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
