The way they talked about it led me to believe that there was &lsquo;something to it&rsquo;. As if it provides some physical enjoyment that is hard to explain in words. I found this was true of starting at the gym, and thought that BJJ might be similar (but perhaps with added adrenaline).</p><p>I signed up for a starter trial course at a local BJJ gym. The course was one month, and you could attend multiple times per week. I attended around six classes over the month.</p><p>Towards the end of the month, I was having some serious lower back pain at work. It was constant, and stuck around whether I was sitting or standing. I went to the physio, who diagnosed me with tight QL muscles.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not actually a clear causal link between BJJ and the back pain. It&rsquo;s just as likely that it was something I had done at the gym through undertraining/overtraining certain muscles. But given the timing, and the fact that the gym adds more to my life than BJJ does, I decided to be conservative and stop BJJ.</p><p>Looking back, I don&rsquo;t really regret it, but perhaps I didn&rsquo;t get far enough into it to get to the point of regret. BJJ seems like a sport that one has to obsess over to enjoy, and I&rsquo;m not in a phase of my life where I&rsquo;m all-in on any particular endeavour.</p><p>BJJ is one of the few things that I tried that I&rsquo;d consider a &lsquo;failure&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t regret trying it, as there&rsquo;s no way that I could have known that beforehand, and things may have turned out different if I hadn&rsquo;t gotten injured. But given the outcome, it&rsquo;s hard not to consider this wasted time.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
