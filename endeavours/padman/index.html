I don&rsquo;t remember much about it besides that it had a CAS (which we were consistently told not to use&mldr;) and could do some slow graphics rendering.
There were a handful of simple games available online for it, and I took it upon myself to build my own.</p><p>Based on the screen dimensions, I thought that pacman would be a good fit (literally). Through much trial and error, reading classpad documentation, and lurking on an online forum with some classpad programmers, I eventually got the game running.</p><p>The first level is the classic pacman level. But I never knew what happened in pacman when you finished the first level. So I designed some different levels (perhaps 10 in all). I also created a level editor and had one or two friends contribute their own levels.</p><p>The game worked very well; surprisingly so. There&rsquo;s even a nice flickering effect when you eat one of the pills, and the ghosts will go back to their starting point. I forget exactly why (perhaps shyness) but I never published the game, or even distributed it locally. I showed a few people and they thought that it was cool.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t recall exactly how long it took, but I spent a lot of time on it. The classpad was not a very-well documented device so it took a lot of learning to get it right.
It was one of the first C++ applications that I had to write. Mostly it was C-with-classes but I still learned a lot during the process.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember playing the game much, but I remember being enchanted by the programming process. The game turned out much better than it had any reason to. I suppose I was quite persistent at that age. I didn&rsquo;t publicise it so it didn&rsquo;t see any &lsquo;real world&rsquo; success per se.</p><p>At the top is a screen capture running the classpad emulator. I wasn&rsquo;t giving any input during the screen capture, but rest assured that everything works as you&rsquo;d expect. The game ran just as well on the classpad physical device.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
