I don&rsquo;t remember much about it except that I hardly practiced outside of lessons (every poor student&rsquo;s downfall).
I gave it up either because I was no longer enjoying it or my parents didn&rsquo;t like paying for something that I wasn&rsquo;t practicing (reasonable).</p><h2 id=university>university</h2><p>I had an itch to pick it back up again during my gap year, and I continued playing during university. I bought a second hand piano from an online marketplace for a few hundred dollars.
I decided not to pay a teacher (mostly because I&rsquo;m cheap). And while I think I wasn&rsquo;t so consistent, I actually clocked quite a few hours of practice over the years. I learned some Chopin and some Scott Joplin, and improved my music theory a lot. I even practiced scales and did some other drills.
I never really had the discipline to get &lsquo;properly good&rsquo; or perform, but I got a lot of value out of learning and practicing the basics. Definitely enough that I don&rsquo;t require the expenses involved or the time spent.
I gradually practiced less and less over the coming years, and sold the piano when I moved away from Perth.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not unlikely that I&rsquo;ll pick up piano again some day, likely with the same attitude of playing for fun.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
