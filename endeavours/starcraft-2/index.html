I don&rsquo;t feel ashamed about it as I didn&rsquo;t feel like there was a high opportunity cost to this time. Not to say I couldn&rsquo;t have been doing better things, but I wasn&rsquo;t mature enough to actually be doing anything better.</p><p>By far the most important thing that I learned from starcraft 2 was the competitive spirit. Not having done much sports up until this point, I had never felt very competitive. Starcraft 2 is the tightest competitive loop that one can experience. You start a game and play 1v1 for 20 minutes. You win or lose, then you start another game. There is some luck involved, but the game is mostly deterministic.</p><p>In learning the competitive spirit, I learned more about how skill curves work. After the first ~100 hours of an activity, your improvements become much smaller. But many small improvements slowly add up. In the end, a professional player often isn&rsquo;t doing &lsquo;better&rsquo; things than you are, they are just doing fewer things wrong. This model of the skill curve is widely applicable, and I&rsquo;m not sure where I&rsquo;d have learned it if not from starcraft 2.</p><p>The competitive scene was fun to follow, and it gave me the feeling of &lsquo;sports is fun to watch&rsquo; that I never felt with traditional sports. But this was never a lasting impact of playing the game.</p><p>After years of play, I finally broke into the masters league in APAC. I stopped playing shortly after this. I tried to find my Battle.net account to get a screenshot of my rank, but it&rsquo;s been too difficult to track down.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
