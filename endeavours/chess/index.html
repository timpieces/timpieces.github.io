My logic was exactly: &ldquo;I could learn League Of Legends or Hearthstone, but if I learn chess then at least people will (falsely) assume I&rsquo;m smart.&rdquo; Given I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a huge difference in fun between the games, this felt like solid reasoning. Looking back, I still think it&rsquo;s true. Noone respects people for spending 1000 hours on League of Legends.</p><p>I grinded many games on chess.com, watched many tutorials, read a few books.
After a year or two I got to around a 1700-ish +/- 100 rating in 10-minute time controls. This is a respectable level for an amateur who started as an adult without any formal training.</p><p>Chess doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of transferable skills. A few of the broadly applicable skills that I learned are:</p><ul><li>A good intuition for tactics vs strategy. This is a useful mental model for many real life problems.<ul><li>Tactics are concrete manoeuvers when the future is very predictable.</li><li>Strategy is a broader plan when the future is too far out to predict.</li></ul></li><li>Challenging your ideas. This comes up in many contexts, but chess makes it very concrete. You need to get past the temptation to assume your ideas are correct. Your first thought with any move should be &ldquo;What is the best response to this move?&rdquo;. You will lose very quickly if you don&rsquo;t do this. More generally, this skill is called &ldquo;critical thinking&rdquo;.</li><li>Thinking on your opponent&rsquo;s time. It&rsquo;s tempting to make your move and then just wait for your opponent to respond. It&rsquo;s much much more effective to be thinking about your opponent&rsquo;s <em>best</em> moves.</li></ul><p>Among people who are competent chess players (let&rsquo;s define this as ELO 1000+), chess is a fun way to communicate. I imagine it&rsquo;s something like dance (of which I know nothing), that playing chess with someone teaches you something about them that words are hard to express. &ldquo;A chess game is worth a few hours of conversation&rdquo; perhaps.</p><p>I was able to attend a game of the 2024 World Chess Championship in Singapore where Gukesh beat Ding Liren. It was fun to watch the usher aunties evict people for using their phones.</p><p>Chess is a great game, and I&rsquo;ve derived a lot of joy from it. However, a lot of the joy is simple pastime and entertainment, rather than deep satisfaction that will provide long term memories.</p><h1 id=ratings>Ratings</h1><h2 id=chesscom>chess.com</h2><p><img src=./chesscom.jpg alt="chess.com rating"></p><h2 id=lichess>lichess</h2><p><img src=./lichess.jpg alt="lichess rating"></p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
