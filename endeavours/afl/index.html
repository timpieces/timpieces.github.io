AFL = Australian Football League) for a year or two during primary school.
I don&rsquo;t remember much about it besides that I didn&rsquo;t have any real talent for it. I started playing young, but a year or two behind others. This meant I had less in-game confidence which leads to getting the ball less which leads to less confidence and the spiral continues. I imagine that this is a common problem for kids in team sports. As a kid it&rsquo;s hard to have the awareness to diagnose these types of problems.
On the plus side, I seemed to have plenty of out-of-game confidence, and the sport helped to develop my social skills. I remember having a positive time overall playing the sport because I enjoyed being around my team members.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
