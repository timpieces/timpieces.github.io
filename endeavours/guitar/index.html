Probably my feeling was that it&rsquo;s provides the best ratio of impact to effort of any instrument. You can have played piano or violin for years, yet an audience will still gravitate to a dudebro with 6 months of guitar experience. Plus, guitars are often just lying around. It&rsquo;s quite rare to stumble across a piano that you can just play. So guitar felt like a useful skill to have.</p><p>I bought the cheapest electric guitar (Squier Strat Pack + FM10G) from a nearby musical shop during covid. The idea with an electric guitar was twofold:</p><ul><li>use headphones to minimise noise in apartment living,</li><li>try rocksmith, a PC game that you can use to make learning guitar more fun.</li></ul><p>Even looking back, this plan seems sound. But guitar really didn&rsquo;t appeal to me and I gave it up after only a few short weeks. I regret not giving it more of a chance, but I wasn&rsquo;t in the best place during covid and I&rsquo;m not surprised that I didn&rsquo;t have the mental discipline to stick with things.</p><p>Overall it was a roughly 500$ experiment. Given how little time I spent on it, this was a little wasteful. I don&rsquo;t remember how much I sold it for, perhaps 100-200$.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
