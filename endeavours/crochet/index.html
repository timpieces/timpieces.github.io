It was a Harry Potter kit. I completely butchered Harry but it was enough to get started.</p><p>I figured that the best way to learn would be to learn with other people. As a frequent user of Meetup, I resolved to finally create my own group and see what it&rsquo;s like to be an organiser. As silly as it sounds, this was quite a big step for me. I&rsquo;d never been good at organising social events, and had been brought up to be quite horrified of this idea.</p><p>After some brainstorming &lsquo;City Crochet Escape&rsquo; was born. The idea was to try and target young professionals for some after work crochet. I knew it was a long shot at the time.</p><p><img src=./citycrochetescape.jpg alt="City Crochet Escape"></p><p>Our first meetup was at a cafe near my apartment. We had three attendees, all of whom were middle aged women. I was quite happy with this. They were easy to chat to and it proved to me that it wasn&rsquo;t so hard to organise a meetup after all.</p><p>We held a few more meetups, with a similar attendance. Our last meetup had no attendees and so the group naturally faded. Still, I found this a very valuable experience and look upon it very fondly.</p><p>Unfortunately, crochet skills are completely non-transferrable skills, but I feel like I could crochet something useful in a bind. I learned a lot about organising social events.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
