Also, it was near my apartment.
Yoga Movement is a very commercial yoga chain in Singapore. I&rsquo;m a big fan of what they&rsquo;ve done to commoditize yoga, as I&rsquo;m not sold on the spiritual side of yoga. I downloaded their app and booked some classes.
I did the basic class many many times.</p><p>Without trying to sound bitter, yoga seems like an activity designed mostly for women&rsquo;s bodies. They seem to have a much better level of default flexibility, which makes it much more enjoyable. It&rsquo;s achievable for men (evidenced by the male yogis at the studio), but it seems to take much more effort.</p><p>I&rsquo;m quite competitive and didn&rsquo;t like that my classmates weren&rsquo;t taking the class very seriously. I saw very few shaking legs during warrior 1, and I felt like I was the only one trying to push myself.</p><p>In my experience there are two types of people who like yoga:</p><ul><li>those who like the stretching,</li><li>those who like the mindfulness.</li></ul><p>I found myself disliking both of these. The stretching wasn&rsquo;t useful when only performed once per week. The mindfulness felt unmotivated and fake. It didn&rsquo;t make me skeptical of yoga as a whole, but it made me realize that I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy continuing.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
