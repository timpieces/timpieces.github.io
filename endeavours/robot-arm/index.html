It was a fun distraction, but overall I was a little unimpressed because:</p><ul><li>the robot arm was slow</li><li>it kept saying my moves were invalid (they weren&rsquo;t)</li><li>it was relatively expensive (1000$)</li><li>it required playing on a special board</li></ul><p>I wanted to try my hand at building a simple chess robot. In principle it didn&rsquo;t seem too hard, although I&rsquo;m aware that these things always take longer than we would like.
In any case, I&rsquo;d been wanting to do an electronics and robotics project for some time, so why not give it a shot?</p><p>Through the process, I really improved my knowledge of robotics and 3d printing / modelling. Spending so much time thinking about the different design tradeoffs when you don&rsquo;t have much experience is a great way to learn.</p><p>As of November 2025, I have a working pen plotter robot, that I intend to write more about in future! Stay tuned.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
