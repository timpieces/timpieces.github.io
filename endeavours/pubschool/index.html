It was a shame, but as an expat in Singapore it&rsquo;s expected.</p><p>As a going away celebration, I joked that I would teach him how to act in a British pub. He&rsquo;s from the US and doesn&rsquo;t drink, and the thought was that he&rsquo;d have to get comfortable in British pubs as it&rsquo;s such a significant part of the culture.</p><p>I thought this would be a good opportunity to try out Claude Code, so I set it to built a revealjs website with 4 lectures. Each lecture was on a different aspect of British pub culture.</p><p>To be clear, this was not slop. I provided a lot of direction to Claude Code and read through every edit. It came out to a presentation that I was very happy with and I presented to him in person. The nice thing about it being a website is that he could revisit it easily and also his partner in the UK could see it.</p><p>The main point of the presentation wasn&rsquo;t so much the tech aspect, but the fact that it gave an excuse to meet up in person each week for four weeks before he left the country. For this reason I think this project was quite a success.</p><p>Below is the landing page:
