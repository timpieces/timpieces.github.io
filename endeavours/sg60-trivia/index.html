For a bit of fun with friends, I organised a trivia night centered around Singaporean culture and history.</p><p>I was learning to use Claude Code at the time, so instead of going with an existing trivia platform, I worked with Claude to build a locally hosted webapp which used websockets to take answers from players. Players would join the game by connecting to the server, and then use their phones to answer the questions. A main display of the question was shown on a different page and displayed on a projector. Finally I had a &lsquo;host&rsquo; screen on my laptop that I could use for admin tasks like changing question, changing scores, etc.</p><p>The host page looked like:

The most &lsquo;value add&rsquo; I provided on the technical side was just high-level engineering advice. I stipulated strategies for recovery, what the overall architecture/technologies should look like, and made a few judgement calls on trading off features for simplicity.</p><p>By far the vast majority of the time on the project was spent coming up with a good suite of questions. I did a lot of research to try to find questions that were fun and novel, and also neither too obvious or too hard. Some of the categories included:</p><ul><li>Politician or Criminal: Given a headshot, is this person a politician or a criminal?</li><li>Singapore Mascots: Questions about some of Singapore&rsquo;s many historical mascots</li><li>Geoguessr round: Given a streetview image, guess the region / place in Singapore</li><li>Singlish Music Lyrics: Given some lyrics translated to Singlish by ChatGPT, guess the original song</li><li>Current Affairs: Do you remember these news stories? What happened in them?</li><li>Rent Prices: Given a propertyguru listing, guess the monthly rent price</li></ul><p>The current affairs questions are particularly time consuming. The hit rate on good articles was very low here. It needs just the right amount of notoriety, but also to be in good taste. Looking back I&rsquo;d have skipped this category if I&rsquo;d known the time commitment.</p><p>All in all the entire quiz took the better part of a week (perhaps 4 days of 8-10 hours), which is much much more than I expected. Perhaps one day of this time was the technical work (would have been much longer without Claude Code), and the rest of it was all question research. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing I was happy to do once to try it, and I enjoyed doing it once, but I&rsquo;d never do it again.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
