It was a time in my life where I wasn&rsquo;t very happy, and didn&rsquo;t know how to be happy. The time was not well spent. It was very much an escape and way to avoid actually improving my life. But I figure it&rsquo;s worth documenting something that I spent over 1000 hours on.</p><p>I played multiplayer a handful of times in university and found the mechanics a lot of fun. I think that the game has a good balance of teamwork, mechanical skill (i.e. muscle memory and pushing buttons at the right time), and tactics. It&rsquo;s skill curve keeps you addicted. Most importantly its short games meant you could iterate very quickly with quick feedback. In the same way as <a href=/endeavours/chess/>chess</a>, I got addicted to starting a game, winning or losing, and then immediately playing again to try to improve. As a result, I believe I cracked into Diamond league 1v1 before I stopped playing.</p><p>There are worse ways to spend your time, but I look back at all of the time spent on it and can&rsquo;t help but think of what else I could have learned. I&rsquo;m conflicted over whether I enjoyed this time. I think the game is a lot of fun, but I look back on 1000 hours of playing and I don&rsquo;t remember a single game. It doesn&rsquo;t fit my retrospective definition of fun.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
