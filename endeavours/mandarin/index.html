Ideally one where I can meet people and it&rsquo;s different to things I have tried in the past.</p><p>I thought about it for a while and realised that Mandarin should be a good fit. It&rsquo;s the second most useful language to know in Singapore, and there are plenty of places offering classes.</p><p>I had done some French duolingo before, but otherwise had no experience learning a language.</p><p>The class was well organised and I like my laoshi (teacher). She was quirky but sweet and patient.</p><p>The main issue with the class was my classmates. There were only three of us, and the other two rarely showed up, or otherwise we had to move classes to try to facilitate their schedule. Moving classes was a massive pain - it was hard to reuse that time slot for other things on short notice and it really stretched out the course.</p><p>That was the main reason that I stopped. I found the language fun enough and the teacher good, but the actual experience of class wasn&rsquo;t good. Learning a language alone kind of sucks. It&rsquo;s much more fun to sound ridiculous with other people. I also figured that I was never really going to use this mandarin (not a big issue except when coupled with the other problems).</p><p>It&rsquo;s been useful to know the very basics of mandarin. Understanding the tones and how they work, plus a few key words has been quite useful. I don&rsquo;t know if it justified the 10-ish hours over the course of 16+ weeks though (because of holidays and moving classes due to classmates). It feels like I could have learned the same amount using duolingo in a fraction of the time (even if duolingo isn&rsquo;t as useful for wholistically learning a language).</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
