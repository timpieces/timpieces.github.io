POVray is raytracing software where you describe a scene using text and it renders it for you. If you describe success scenes (parameterised on time) then you can render all the frame and join them into an animation.</p><p>I chose to animate a Newton&rsquo;s Cradle, but there was extreme scope creep. I modelled what one might consider to be Newton&rsquo;s writing desk. Each object took quite a lot of time to model individually. For example I&rsquo;m quite sure that the tree was fractally generated.</p><p>The animation was well received but I don&rsquo;t think it was the most visually impressive. It was a good lesson to work smarter and not harder, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the time that I spent on this.</p><p>The gif shown above is very low-resolution, but it gets across the idea.
