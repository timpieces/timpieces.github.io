I decided to focus it around my initial year or two of learning programming as it provides the most insight into the endeavour. I may split out more endeavours as it&rsquo;s been such an important part of my life)</p><p>I remember as a young teenager always wanting to understand how technology really worked. In previous decades, I think that this led people to become fascinated with cars. I had been playing games on our family&rsquo;s computer since I was 6, so I gravitated towards computers.</p><p>I begged my parents for a laptop for my 13th birthday. They relented and through a combination of my allowance and birthday money I was able to buy a 600AUD laptop.</p><p>In a quest to better understand how my computer worked, I started trying to learn the C programming language. I remember it being quite painstaking. I started reading through K&amp;R C and experimenting. This was before youtube, before LLMs, before discord, etc. I&rsquo;m sure there were some IRC channels I could have joined for help, but it&rsquo;s not something I was aware of as a ~14 year old in 2007. Perhaps no youtube was an advantage at the time; I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d have learned to program if I could be watching nonsense on youtube all day.</p><p>Somehow I built up an ability to just keep trying things until they worked. If they didn&rsquo;t work I&rsquo;d research as much as possible and try things. The analogy I used was &lsquo;bashing my head against the wall until the wall fell down&rsquo;. This has been one of the most useful skills I&rsquo;ve ever learned. While I&rsquo;m sometimes accused of taking too long to consult others for help, I always get to the root of the issue and learn a lot in the process. The learning makes me more efficient in the future.</p><p>I focused on Windows programming at the time as I wasn&rsquo;t yet at the point where I as trying out Linux (I don&rsquo;t think I got my first Ubuntu disc until late high school). I got quite familiar with the Windows C API and was building GUIs by hand. I knew nothing of the tooling available on Windows at the time. My first IDE was DevC++ (which even at the time was likely obsolete and did no favours for Windows developers).</p><p>After gaining some confidence with the language, I joined an online C programming forum at cboard.cprogramming.com . From 2009 - 2014 I posted as user &lsquo;DeadPlanet&rsquo;. I had 375 posts, not too bad. Below is my first ever post:</p><p><img src=./deadplanet.png alt=DeadPlanet></p><p>I enjoyed being part of a community of programmers and I learned a lot from both helping others and being publically wrong about things, something that I&rsquo;ve gotten much worse at over the years (I&rsquo;m still just as wrong, but not as good about doing it publically).</p><p>I&rsquo;ll try to detail some of the projects that I worked on at this time in other places e.g. <a href=/endeavours/padman/>Padman</a>.</p><p>Out of all the endeavours that I have tried, self-learning programming at such a young age definitely had the most profound impact on the path of my life.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
