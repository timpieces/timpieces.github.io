Art? Hobby? Skill? Novelty? Let&rsquo;s try novelty.</p><p>This is by far the nerdiest endeavour I&rsquo;ve ever done (nothing wrong with that!).</p><p>I saw a video somewhere online of someone doing fancy tricks with a pen and I was fascinated. I was also the kind of kid who was into juggling and had to learn how to flip over casino chips after watching Casino Royale, so I was very liable to get hooked on this sort of thing.</p><p>I practiced a lot and annoyed the people around me for the next few years dropping pens on the desk all the time. Looking back I actually think it&rsquo;s quite a wholesome hobby, but at the time it was very fringe and I was rather embarassed about it.</p><p>I joined the online pen spinning community at the &lsquo;UPSB&rsquo; online forum, and posted for a few years as user &lsquo;Tim&rsquo;. I remember it being quite a safe and welcoming community with plenty of smart people. I&rsquo;ve heard it wasn&rsquo;t always like this, I suppose I got lucky or was ignorant. One thing that was useful about being in online forums in the late 2000s was that it was one of the few chances for a young teenager to interact with adults (and other teens) without being treated as a non-adult. People in online forums were just treated as people, and as someone who really disliked the lack of empowerment that comes with being a teenager, I really enjoyed this.</p><p>I was a very average pen-spinner, and I only participated in one video. I organised a video for people who had been learning for one year. I think the theme was just an excuse to make a video that I could participate in. The video is still online (youtube is amazing at archiving) and can be seen here:<div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CqSqJ0yJSuk?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div></p><p>My webcam (a PS2 eye-toy with some shady PC drivers) has terrible quality and my own video turned out terrible. Still, I look back fondly on having put in the effort to organise others and make the video.</p></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
