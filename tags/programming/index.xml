&lt;p&gt;I attended a conference in October 2025 where I played chess against a robot. It was a fun distraction, but overall I was a little unimpressed because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the robot arm was slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it kept saying my moves were invalid (they weren&amp;rsquo;t)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was relatively expensive (1000$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it required playing on a special board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try my hand at building a simple chess robot. In principle it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too hard, although I&amp;rsquo;m aware that these things always take longer than we would like.
In any case, I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to do an electronics and robotics project for some time, so why not give it a shot?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>sg60 trivia</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/sg60-trivia/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/sg60-trivia/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;2025 was Singapore&amp;rsquo;s 60th year since becoming an independent state. For a bit of fun with friends, I organised a trivia night centered around Singaporean culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was learning to use Claude Code at the time, so instead of going with an existing trivia platform, I worked with Claude to build a locally hosted webapp which used websockets to take answers from players. Players would join the game by connecting to the server, and then use their phones to answer the questions. A main display of the question was shown on a different page and displayed on a projector. Finally I had a &amp;lsquo;host&amp;rsquo; screen on my laptop that I could use for admin tasks like changing question, changing scores, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>pubschool</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/pubschool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/pubschool/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend that I met in Singapore decided to move to the UK. It was a shame, but as an expat in Singapore it&amp;rsquo;s expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a going away celebration, I joked that I would teach him how to act in a British pub. He&amp;rsquo;s from the US and doesn&amp;rsquo;t drink, and the thought was that he&amp;rsquo;d have to get comfortable in British pubs as it&amp;rsquo;s such a significant part of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>rust gameboy emulator</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/rust-gameboy-emulator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/rust-gameboy-emulator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A confluence of factors led me to build a gameboy emulator in rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had some time off during 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I felt motivated to learn rust. I was a professional C++ developer and learning rust felt like it would broaden my core skillset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by emulators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have very fond memories of playing pokemon blue as a child.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t written an emulator before, but the idea seemed mostly simply in principle. The great thing about the gameboy is how well documented it is. I remember using a combination of sources for the documentation but otherwise it was quite straightforward.
The goal was singular, to the to the point where I could play a full game of pokemon blue in the emulator. This meant that really all I needed was controls and the video display (i.e. no audio).
A lot of the time that went into this was:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>silence of the lamb</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/silence-of-the-lamb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/silence-of-the-lamb/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./silenceofthelamb.jpg" alt="Silence of the Lamb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a university break, two friends and I decided to participate in a weekend game jam. The idea was that you sleep as little as you can and you build a game over 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some initial brainstorming, we settled on a game where you played as a lamb trying to escape a sacrifice. There was a procedurally generated world that you ran through, and you had to escape the tribespeople trying to catch you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>newton's cradle</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/newtons-cradle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/newtons-cradle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./newtonscradle.gif" alt="Newton&amp;rsquo;s Cradle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my university assignments required creating and rendering a animation in POVray. POVray is raytracing software where you describe a scene using text and it renders it for you. If you describe success scenes (parameterised on time) then you can render all the frame and join them into an animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to animate a Newton&amp;rsquo;s Cradle, but there was extreme scope creep. I modelled what one might consider to be Newton&amp;rsquo;s writing desk. Each object took quite a lot of time to model individually. For example I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that the tree was fractally generated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>padman</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/padman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/padman/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./padman.gif" alt="Padman"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I was required to buy a Casio Classpad calculator. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about it besides that it had a CAS (which we were consistently told not to use&amp;hellip;) and could do some slow graphics rendering.
There were a handful of simple games available online for it, and I took it upon myself to build my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the screen dimensions, I thought that pacman would be a good fit (literally). Through much trial and error, reading classpad documentation, and lurking on an online forum with some classpad programmers, I eventually got the game running.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>learning programming</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/learning-programming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/learning-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;(Note: I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to date this entry, as I&amp;rsquo;ve never really stopped programming. I decided to focus it around my initial year or two of learning programming as it provides the most insight into the endeavour. I may split out more endeavours as it&amp;rsquo;s been such an important part of my life)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember as a young teenager always wanting to understand how technology really worked. In previous decades, I think that this led people to become fascinated with cars. I had been playing games on our family&amp;rsquo;s computer since I was 6, so I gravitated towards computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
