&lt;p&gt;I attended a conference in October 2025 where I played chess against a robot. It was a fun distraction, but overall I was a little unimpressed because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the robot arm was slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it kept saying my moves were invalid (they weren&amp;rsquo;t)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was relatively expensive (1000$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it required playing on a special board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try my hand at building a simple chess robot. In principle it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too hard, although I&amp;rsquo;m aware that these things always take longer than we would like.
In any case, I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to do an electronics and robotics project for some time, so why not give it a shot?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
