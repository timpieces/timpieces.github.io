We were brainstorming ideas to replace our friends who were leaving Singapore. We resolved to organise a photowalk to meet people and for my friend to improve his photography skills. The hook of our walk would be that it is followed by a social hour where the attendees share a beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>crochet</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/crochet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/crochet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a crochet kit from a bookstore in Singapore.

&lt;p&gt;I figured that the best way to learn would be to learn with other people. As a frequent user of Meetup, I resolved to finally create my own group and see what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be an organiser. As silly as it sounds, this was quite a big step for me. I&amp;rsquo;d never been good at organising social events, and had been brought up to be quite horrified of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
