&lt;p&gt;At least in Australia, it seems that every middle-aged man tries brewing his own beer at some point in his life.
With the knowledge that I&amp;rsquo;m likely to follow in that path one day, but that I have some time off of work in 2025, I figured why not get it out of the way now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a kit online, and a fridge to control the fermentation temperature in Singapore&amp;rsquo;s yeast-unfriendly weather. The kit was a partial mash, and I enjoyed the brewing process, so I found my local homebrew store and bought some more gear and ingredients for another.
After the first two brews, I tried to make some cider with a friend. We bought some cheap green apples from the supermarket and manually cut, blended, and squeezed them. Despite the very adhoc process, the cider actually turned out quite decent (but very sour).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
