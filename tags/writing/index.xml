I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to try it out for some time, and so I encouraged us to try to blog frequently to get over our shared fear of public writing. It worked well. We blogged every two days for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dropped it and picked it up again over the next year(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come late 2025 and I have more time on my hands, I decide to supplement the frequent low-quality blogging with timpieces.me . I thought it would be nice to have a place to put more substantial writing, usually of a technical nature. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the plan for now. If I find that I&amp;rsquo;m not writing enough, I&amp;rsquo;ll likely aim to publish lower quality more frequent snippets, as the practice of writing brings the major benefit for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
