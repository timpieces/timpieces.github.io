&lt;p&gt;As a kid, we were forced to do cross-country training. Noone ever explained to me that running is supposed to be uncomfortable, and so I was terrible at it. Being terrible at something as a kid is a surefire way to hate it the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late high-school I was overweight, and I took up some running to lose weight. It worked and I got down to a healthy weight (although still not &amp;lsquo;slim&amp;rsquo;). But I never got interested in running itself, and I doubt I surpassed 5km.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>robot arm</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/robot-arm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/robot-arm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./robot_arm.jpg" alt="robot arm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a conference in October 2025 where I played chess against a robot. It was a fun distraction, but overall I was a little unimpressed because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the robot arm was slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it kept saying my moves were invalid (they weren&amp;rsquo;t)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was relatively expensive (1000$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it required playing on a special board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try my hand at building a simple chess robot. In principle it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too hard, although I&amp;rsquo;m aware that these things always take longer than we would like.
In any case, I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to do an electronics and robotics project for some time, so why not give it a shot?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>photowalk</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/photowalk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/photowalk/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A friend and I got together over beers a few months ago (as of this writing in late 2025). We were brainstorming ideas to replace our friends who were leaving Singapore. We resolved to organise a photowalk to meet people and for my friend to improve his photography skills. The hook of our walk would be that it is followed by a social hour where the attendees share a beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>3d printing</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/3d-printing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/3d-printing/</guid><description>Learning 3d modelling and printing</description></item><item><title>cycling</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/cycling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/cycling/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a strong interest in the &amp;lsquo;art of cycling&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve never even watched a Tour de France stage. I like cycling because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riding fast downhill is thrilling (while feeling relatively safe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good, low-impact exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It came to me at a time in life when I had forgotten how important hobbies are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two points are self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I had been focusing on my career to the exclusion of everything else. I slept on a mattress on the floor, owned very little, and had no hobbies. I would spend the weekend relaxing, drinking, socialising, playing the odd video game. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>homebrew</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/homebrew/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/homebrew/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./homebrew.jpg" alt="homebrew"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in Australia, it seems that every middle-aged man tries brewing his own beer at some point in his life.
With the knowledge that I&amp;rsquo;m likely to follow in that path one day, but that I have some time off of work in 2025, I figured why not get it out of the way now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a kit online, and a fridge to control the fermentation temperature in Singapore&amp;rsquo;s yeast-unfriendly weather. The kit was a partial mash, and I enjoyed the brewing process, so I found my local homebrew store and bought some more gear and ingredients for another.
After the first two brews, I tried to make some cider with a friend. We bought some cheap green apples from the supermarket and manually cut, blended, and squeezed them. Despite the very adhoc process, the cider actually turned out quite decent (but very sour).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>blogging</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/blogging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/blogging/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I started blogging in 2024 with my partner. I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to try it out for some time, and so I encouraged us to try to blog frequently to get over our shared fear of public writing. It worked well. We blogged every two days for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dropped it and picked it up again over the next year(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come late 2025 and I have more time on my hands, I decide to supplement the frequent low-quality blogging with timpieces.me . I thought it would be nice to have a place to put more substantial writing, usually of a technical nature. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the plan for now. If I find that I&amp;rsquo;m not writing enough, I&amp;rsquo;ll likely aim to publish lower quality more frequent snippets, as the practice of writing brings the major benefit for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>sg60 trivia</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/sg60-trivia/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/sg60-trivia/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;2025 was Singapore&amp;rsquo;s 60th year since becoming an independent state. For a bit of fun with friends, I organised a trivia night centered around Singaporean culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was learning to use Claude Code at the time, so instead of going with an existing trivia platform, I worked with Claude to build a locally hosted webapp which used websockets to take answers from players. Players would join the game by connecting to the server, and then use their phones to answer the questions. A main display of the question was shown on a different page and displayed on a projector. Finally I had a &amp;lsquo;host&amp;rsquo; screen on my laptop that I could use for admin tasks like changing question, changing scores, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>mahjong</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/mahjong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/mahjong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I joined my cycling club in Singapore, I was required to join the entire social association surrounding it. This turned out to be great, as the association organises many activities and is full of great people. Through this association, I picked up casual mahjong games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association plays the &amp;lsquo;British&amp;rsquo; version of Mahjong, which is not well known and I think quite different to any of the America/Chinese/Singaporean rules. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how representative it is of Mahjong in general, and I&amp;rsquo;m not confident that I have a good feel for &amp;lsquo;Mahjong&amp;rsquo; having only played this variant.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>pubschool</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/pubschool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/pubschool/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend that I met in Singapore decided to move to the UK. It was a shame, but as an expat in Singapore it&amp;rsquo;s expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a going away celebration, I joked that I would teach him how to act in a British pub. He&amp;rsquo;s from the US and doesn&amp;rsquo;t drink, and the thought was that he&amp;rsquo;d have to get comfortable in British pubs as it&amp;rsquo;s such a significant part of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>brazilian jiu jitsu</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/brazilian-jiu-jitsu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/brazilian-jiu-jitsu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I&amp;rsquo;d had many people get into BJJ. The way they talked about it led me to believe that there was &amp;lsquo;something to it&amp;rsquo;. As if it provides some physical enjoyment that is hard to explain in words. I found this was true of starting at the gym, and thought that BJJ might be similar (but perhaps with added adrenaline).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for a starter trial course at a local BJJ gym. The course was one month, and you could attend multiple times per week. I attended around six classes over the month.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>crochet</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/crochet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/crochet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a crochet kit from a bookstore in Singapore. It was a Harry Potter kit. I completely butchered Harry but it was enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured that the best way to learn would be to learn with other people. As a frequent user of Meetup, I resolved to finally create my own group and see what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be an organiser. As silly as it sounds, this was quite a big step for me. I&amp;rsquo;d never been good at organising social events, and had been brought up to be quite horrified of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>yoga</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/yoga/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/yoga/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I chose yoga because it was so different to any hobbies that I had tried before. Also, it was near my apartment.
Yoga Movement is a very commercial yoga chain in Singapore. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of what they&amp;rsquo;ve done to commoditize yoga, as I&amp;rsquo;m not sold on the spiritual side of yoga. I downloaded their app and booked some classes.
I did the basic class many many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without trying to sound bitter, yoga seems like an activity designed mostly for women&amp;rsquo;s bodies. They seem to have a much better level of default flexibility, which makes it much more enjoyable. It&amp;rsquo;s achievable for men (evidenced by the male yogis at the studio), but it seems to take much more effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>fencing</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/fencing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/fencing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In Singapore I live in a building which contains my gym. On the way to the gym I noticed a fencing club, so I decided to give it a shot. I messaged the number and after a few months they said they were organising an adult beginners course. I signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class was foil. I diligently did my drills and learned my footwork. I did my parries and ripostes. We lunged&amp;hellip; a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>skiing</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/skiing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/skiing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I tried skiing for 3 days in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally this would definitely not be enough to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason that I include it as an endeavour is that I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of having given it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think skiing is very difficult to learn as an adult, especially without dedicated lessons or a lot of time to spend on it. I joined some friends for 3 days in Japan and tried skiing with no instruction at all, and my friends were snowboarders. It went as poorly as you&amp;rsquo;d expect.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>mandarin</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/mandarin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/mandarin/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2023 I was looking for a new hobby in Singapore. Ideally one where I can meet people and it&amp;rsquo;s different to things I have tried in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about it for a while and realised that Mandarin should be a good fit. It&amp;rsquo;s the second most useful language to know in Singapore, and there are plenty of places offering classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had done some French duolingo before, but otherwise had no experience learning a language.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>badminton</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/badminton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/badminton/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I moved to Singapore I wanted to put in a concerted effort to make some friends. Sports felt like a good way to do this, and choosing a popular local sport felt like a good way to make friends while integrating into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a meetup group which organised games and you could pay to join. It was suitable for beginners. I did a single coached lesson to understand the basics and then I started playing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>rust gameboy emulator</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/rust-gameboy-emulator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/rust-gameboy-emulator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A confluence of factors led me to build a gameboy emulator in rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had some time off during 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I felt motivated to learn rust. I was a professional C++ developer and learning rust felt like it would broaden my core skillset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by emulators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have very fond memories of playing pokemon blue as a child.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t written an emulator before, but the idea seemed mostly simply in principle. The great thing about the gameboy is how well documented it is. I remember using a combination of sources for the documentation but otherwise it was quite straightforward.
The goal was singular, to the to the point where I could play a full game of pokemon blue in the emulator. This meant that really all I needed was controls and the video display (i.e. no audio).
A lot of the time that went into this was:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>bouldering</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/bouldering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/bouldering/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I started bouldering with some friends and colleagues in Sydney towards the end of 2021. Some of them were strong boulderers and they were all great people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned some basic technique from youtube videos, and had an initial period of improving quickly. Still, I never bouldered enough to get past the beginner level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated ripping skin off my fingers (as a full time software developer), everything else about the sport is quite enjoyable. The waiting around in bouldering is a good way to relax and take things slowly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>gym</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/gym/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/gym/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Starting a gym routine in late 2021 was one of the most impactful changes in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up I was always very skeptical of gyms and resistance training. It seemed very vain and an expensive way to get exercise.
During covid I tried some at-home calisthenics. It seemed more stimulating than training at a gym. While learning about the basics of calisthenics I became more aware of the benefits of a gym. This learning coupled with encouragement and guidance from a friend led me to try a single session, followed by a two-week trial, followed by a (now 4+ year) membership.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>guitar</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/guitar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/guitar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact reason that I decided to give the guitar a shot.
Probably my feeling was that it&amp;rsquo;s provides the best ratio of impact to effort of any instrument. You can have played piano or violin for years, yet an audience will still gravitate to a dudebro with 6 months of guitar experience. Plus, guitars are often just lying around. It&amp;rsquo;s quite rare to stumble across a piano that you can just play. So guitar felt like a useful skill to have.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>tennis</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/tennis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/tennis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had two major phases of playing tennis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My parents took us to weekend tennis practice as kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some friends in Sydney needed a fourth for doubles, so I joined them for casual games and post-game drinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid I had some minor amount of talent, but I never pursued it seriously. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how long we took the weekend classes for, but it was at most a year or two.
There are some minor regrets here. While I don&amp;rsquo;t think tennis is a very well-designed sport (at least when it comes to playing for fun), I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great outlet for kids to learn about competition. Australia has a lot of infrastructure around it and a big tennis following and community. As someone who struggled to understand the mechanics of team sports, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that I&amp;rsquo;d have responded well to a competitive individual sport. And it likely would have helped the fact that I was an overweight kid too.
That being said, I don&amp;rsquo;t think our parents had a lot of money to put us through something like tennis lessons unless we showed some significant passion. I think this is a reasonable decision.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>rocket league</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/rocket-league/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/rocket-league/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a little remiss to include Rocket League as an endeavour. It was a time in my life where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very happy, and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to be happy. The time was not well spent. It was very much an escape and way to avoid actually improving my life. But I figure it&amp;rsquo;s worth documenting something that I spent over 1000 hours on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played multiplayer a handful of times in university and found the mechanics a lot of fun. I think that the game has a good balance of teamwork, mechanical skill (i.e. muscle memory and pushing buttons at the right time), and tactics. It&amp;rsquo;s skill curve keeps you addicted. Most importantly its short games meant you could iterate very quickly with quick feedback. In the same way as &lt;a href="https://timpieces.me/endeavours/chess/"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt;, I got addicted to starting a game, winning or losing, and then immediately playing again to try to improve. As a result, I believe I cracked into Diamond league 1v1 before I stopped playing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>piano</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/piano/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/piano/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="childhood"&gt;childhood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a year or two of keyboard lessons in primary school. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about it except that I hardly practiced outside of lessons (every poor student&amp;rsquo;s downfall).
I gave it up either because I was no longer enjoying it or my parents didn&amp;rsquo;t like paying for something that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t practicing (reasonable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="university"&gt;university&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an itch to pick it back up again during my gap year, and I continued playing during university. I bought a second hand piano from an online marketplace for a few hundred dollars.
I decided not to pay a teacher (mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m cheap). And while I think I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so consistent, I actually clocked quite a few hours of practice over the years. I learned some Chopin and some Scott Joplin, and improved my music theory a lot. I even practiced scales and did some other drills.
I never really had the discipline to get &amp;lsquo;properly good&amp;rsquo; or perform, but I got a lot of value out of learning and practicing the basics. Definitely enough that I don&amp;rsquo;t require the expenses involved or the time spent.
I gradually practiced less and less over the coming years, and sold the piano when I moved away from Perth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>basketball</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/basketball/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/basketball/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had two major phases of playing basketball:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a year in primary school I played in a local league for a year,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During university I frequently played casual games with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time in my primary school team went very similar to my time playing &lt;a href="https://timpieces.me/endeavours/afl/"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt;. Kids eh? Not much to say here but I remember being terrible in games, but really enjoying practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University gave me plenty of spare time, so I took to improving at shooting hoops. The games were much more casual, half-court, and often we&amp;rsquo;d just do shooting games. I got a lot of enjoyment out of this, and later in life when living near a basketball court I usually buy a basketball so that I can shoot hoops. I think my form is decent and I hope to live near a hoop again sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>chess</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/chess/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/chess/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I took up chess in university (approx 2014). My logic was exactly: &amp;ldquo;I could learn League Of Legends or Hearthstone, but if I learn chess then at least people will (falsely) assume I&amp;rsquo;m smart.&amp;rdquo; Given I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting a huge difference in fun between the games, this felt like solid reasoning. Looking back, I still think it&amp;rsquo;s true. Noone respects people for spending 1000 hours on League of Legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grinded many games on chess.com, watched many tutorials, read a few books.
After a year or two I got to around a 1700-ish +/- 100 rating in 10-minute time controls. This is a respectable level for an amateur who started as an adult without any formal training.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>silence of the lamb</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/silence-of-the-lamb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/silence-of-the-lamb/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./silenceofthelamb.jpg" alt="Silence of the Lamb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a university break, two friends and I decided to participate in a weekend game jam. The idea was that you sleep as little as you can and you build a game over 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some initial brainstorming, we settled on a game where you played as a lamb trying to escape a sacrifice. There was a procedurally generated world that you ran through, and you had to escape the tribespeople trying to catch you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>newton's cradle</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/newtons-cradle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/newtons-cradle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./newtonscradle.gif" alt="Newton&amp;rsquo;s Cradle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my university assignments required creating and rendering a animation in POVray. POVray is raytracing software where you describe a scene using text and it renders it for you. If you describe success scenes (parameterised on time) then you can render all the frame and join them into an animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to animate a Newton&amp;rsquo;s Cradle, but there was extreme scope creep. I modelled what one might consider to be Newton&amp;rsquo;s writing desk. Each object took quite a lot of time to model individually. For example I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that the tree was fractally generated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>starcraft 2</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/starcraft-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/starcraft-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Much of my high school evenings were spent playing starcraft 2. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel ashamed about it as I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like there was a high opportunity cost to this time. Not to say I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been doing better things, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t mature enough to actually be doing anything better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most important thing that I learned from starcraft 2 was the competitive spirit. Not having done much sports up until this point, I had never felt very competitive. Starcraft 2 is the tightest competitive loop that one can experience. You start a game and play 1v1 for 20 minutes. You win or lose, then you start another game. There is some luck involved, but the game is mostly deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>padman</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/padman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/padman/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./padman.gif" alt="Padman"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I was required to buy a Casio Classpad calculator. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about it besides that it had a CAS (which we were consistently told not to use&amp;hellip;) and could do some slow graphics rendering.
There were a handful of simple games available online for it, and I took it upon myself to build my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the screen dimensions, I thought that pacman would be a good fit (literally). Through much trial and error, reading classpad documentation, and lurking on an online forum with some classpad programmers, I eventually got the game running.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>squash</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/squash/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/squash/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I played squash in my late teens, but just casually with my brother.
Normally I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother considering this as an endeavour worth mentioning, except that it&amp;rsquo;s a sport that I&amp;rsquo;ve since had occasion to play casually quite a few times.
I played with a friend during university, and colleagues at multiple workplaces.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never had any formal training, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got enough of the basics to play a decent game.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>learning programming</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/learning-programming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/learning-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;(Note: I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to date this entry, as I&amp;rsquo;ve never really stopped programming. I decided to focus it around my initial year or two of learning programming as it provides the most insight into the endeavour. I may split out more endeavours as it&amp;rsquo;s been such an important part of my life)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember as a young teenager always wanting to understand how technology really worked. In previous decades, I think that this led people to become fascinated with cars. I had been playing games on our family&amp;rsquo;s computer since I was 6, so I gravitated towards computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>pen spinning</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/pen-spinning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/pen-spinning/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to categorise this. Art? Hobby? Skill? Novelty? Let&amp;rsquo;s try novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far the nerdiest endeavour I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done (nothing wrong with that!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a video somewhere online of someone doing fancy tricks with a pen and I was fascinated. I was also the kind of kid who was into juggling and had to learn how to flip over casino chips after watching Casino Royale, so I was very liable to get hooked on this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>afl</title><link>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/afl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timpieces.me/endeavours/afl/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I played Aussie Rules Football (a.k.a. AFL = Australian Football League) for a year or two during primary school.
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about it besides that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any real talent for it. I started playing young, but a year or two behind others. This meant I had less in-game confidence which leads to getting the ball less which leads to less confidence and the spiral continues. I imagine that this is a common problem for kids in team sports. As a kid it&amp;rsquo;s hard to have the awareness to diagnose these types of problems.
On the plus side, I seemed to have plenty of out-of-game confidence, and the sport helped to develop my social skills. I remember having a positive time overall playing the sport because I enjoyed being around my team members.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
