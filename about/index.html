I like to keep my identity small, but roughly speaking:</p><ul><li>I often work as a software developer,</li><li>I love trying new hobbies and pursuits,</li><li>My curiousity exceeds my free time,</li><li>I&rsquo;m Australian-born, Singapore-based.</li></ul><p>timpieces is my online personal site, and a weakly-associated personal handle (finding my real name on the internet is not intended to be hard). This site serves as a blog, a journal of my endeavours, and will likely be a general catch-all for things I want to share.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re at-all interested in what&rsquo;s on this site, please reach out! Send an email to &lsquo;hello&rsquo; at the current domain and I&rsquo;ll receive it.</p><h1 id=timpiecesme>timpieces.me</h1><p>This site is built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. Most of the setup (but none of the content!) is coded alongside ChatGPT Codex.</p><p>The site is very much a work-in-progress. I intend to build it out in parallel to the content. If you have any suggestions, please reach out!</p><h2 id=endeavours>Endeavours</h2><p>For a long time I had been toying with the idea of some sort of &lsquo;portfolio for things that add meaning to my life&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s very common to document your professional achievements, but rarely is there any emphasis on personal growth and exploring the world.
I&rsquo;ve called this &rsquo;endeavours&rsquo; as a catch-all term for hobbies, projects, and anything that I personally wanted to try. If you know of a more standard word for this, please let me know!</p><p>My main requirement for this was that the content had to live a long time. I&rsquo;m expecting to build this up over the course of my life, and I don&rsquo;t want some flavour-of-the-month web framework making it hard to maintain this.
All of these endeavours are just stored and document in markdown files, and Hugo will kindly serve them with some tags based on their frontmatter.</p></div></header><div class=page__entries></div></section></main><footer class=site-footer></footer></body></html>
